# Loan-Repayment
Problem  : For most financial institutions, such as banks and multi-finance companies, their main source of income is coming from their lending activities. By engaging in this activity, it means that lenders are exposed to the potential risk, where debtors stop repaying their loans, causing losses to the lenders. To mitigate this loss, lenders are expected to appropriately choose who are qualified for a loan, at what rate, and at what amount.   Objectives : In spite of all the precautions taken by the lending club or any other online platform, there are some borrowers who would not pay their loan back. It is not very easy to predict who these borrowers would be if you just take a look at thousands of borrower profiles. This is where machine learning helps. The objective of the project is to identify the borrowers who will default the loan.
